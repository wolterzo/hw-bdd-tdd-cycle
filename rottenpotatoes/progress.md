# Part 1

Part 1 actually went without much of a hitch. Except for forking and cloning
the wrong repo initially (and spending more time than we would like to admit
trying to figure out why the Gemfile was broken), after Reilly showed us the
right repo we got back on track. We were able to add the director column and
migrate the updated database successfully (although we never formally tested
this). In all, we probably spent 45 minutes (30 minutes in class and only 15
afterwards) on this part of the assignment.

# Part 2

We were able to make some good progress on Part 2 before hitting the timecap
of two and a half hours. After working through documentation, StackOverflow,
and random useless web sites, we were able to put together a decent looking,
Ruby-esque set of RSpec tests that failed (of course, because we never got a
working implementation of the new features together). We did not get to code
a test for the RESTful route for similar movies by director. Both of us felt
that we did not have enough practice with actually writing Rails to test the
functionalities of procedures and MVC interactions without implementing them
first. To this end, we also did not have very much luck. In all, this was in
about just under two hours.
